Fix for a relationship bug in Europa 1400: The Guild Gold Edition

Copy the file into the resources/gamedata/ai/ subdirectory of your Europa 1400: The Guild Gold Edition install directory, overwriting the existing file.

Afterwards always select "Actual History" when starting a new game. This will fix the issue where relationships between everyone reset every few years whenever the pope or emperor die, as both the pope and emperor will live (e: or at least not be replaced) for 30 years, which should make it infrequent enough not to be an issue.

It is not possible to extend it more without causing issues and leaving the imperial offices empty.
