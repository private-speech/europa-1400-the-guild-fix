Fix for a relationship bug in Europa 1400: The Guild Gold Edition

Copy the file into the resources/gamedata/ai/ subdirectory of your Europa 1400: The Guild Gold Edition install directory, overwriting the existing file.

Afterwards always select "Actual History" when starting a new game. This will fix the issue where relationships between everyone reset every few years, as both the first pope and emperor will live until 2020, which should be more than enough for most games.
